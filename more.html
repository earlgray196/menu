	<!--
	1.Don't forget to add the title
	2.Only the title is within head, other elements such as h1, h2, are within body.
	3.The space in the CSS (the space after font-size is not required. style="font-size: 60px" 
	4.Don't forget to add ; while writing CSS.
	5,Style sheet will be placed in the head of our pages.
	6,We can put the style either before or after the title. After is probably more common.
	7,Use a link to link your page to the CSS file. Put the link after the title.
	<link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
	8,Use ID or class to specify the element that you want to change.
	9,The difference between ID and class: ID is an individual, a class is a group. An ID can only be used on time per page. A class can be used over and over again. ID will overwrite a class if they are both selecting the same thing.
	10,Class can be used only once if you want! The recommendation is not to use ID.
	11,CLass-> .intro{} ID-> #intro{}
	12,Don't forget that margin, padding, and borders add width to the left and the right.
	13,The total width will be content+margin+padding+borders.
